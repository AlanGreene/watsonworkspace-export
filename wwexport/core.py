    The downside to this approach is that if file name collisions occurs,
    the names will be non-deterministic and depend on when the files are created
    relative to prior executions of this method. For instance, myfile.txt and
    myfile 1.txt will refer to two files with title myfile.txt. Because we
    start from newest to oldest, myfile.txt will normally be the newest file,
    and myfile 1.txt will be older. This may already be counter-intuitive, but
    additionally, if the task was already run and an earlier file was downloaded
    as myfile.txt, it's possible the newer file will be named myfile 1.txt"""
